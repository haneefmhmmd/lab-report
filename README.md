# Lab Report Generator [Under Development]

The Lab Report Generator is an application designed to simplify the process of creating laboratory reports for mid-tier pathology testing laboratories. These labs often rely on manual methods such as Word or Excel to create their reports, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. This application provides an efficient and user-friendly way to generate professional-looking lab reports.
